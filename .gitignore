#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if python versions differ or dependencies are platforms-dependent,
#   pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not install all needed dependencies.
#   ruff is used for formating, so its cache files are ignored.
